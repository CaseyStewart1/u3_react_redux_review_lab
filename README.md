# React Redux Review Lab

For this lab, we will be creating a mock social media site where users are able to add comments to images

You will need to make a back end with at least 2 models, and populate the data as needed

Then, create a front end using React Redux

Focus on the Read methods first, then work on Create, Update, and Delete
