# React Redux Review Lab

Now that we have worked with the React Redux library, lets put it to use in creating a mock social media site. We will be building up a Redux front end, connected to an Express backend, where users are able to add comments to posts.

You will need to make a back end with at least 3 models (posts, users, comments), and populate the data as needed

Focus on the Read methods first, then work on Create, Update, and Delete

Be sure to use your notes and previous labs as a resource to help you through this challenge
