Now that we have worked with the React Redux library, lets put it to use in creating a mock social media/travel review site. We will be building up a Redux front end, connected to an Express backend, where users are able to add comments to images posts of popular travel locations 



## Requirements:

- A Full Stack MERN app built with React Redux, Express, and MongoDB
- Your site should display posts of popular travel locations, which users should be able to comment and add reviews to
- A back end with at least 2 models (posts & comments), and populate the data as needed


## Recommendations
- Focus on the Read methods first, then work on Create, Update, and Delete once we have the Front and Back ends connected
- Be sure to use your notes and previous labs as a resource to help you through this challenge
