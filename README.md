# React Redux Review Lab

![React](https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2017/12/Bildschirmfoto-2017-12-01-um-08.53.32.png)

Now that we have worked with the React Redux library, lets put it to use in creating a mock travel blog site. Where users are able to add comments on different  locations. We will be building up a Redux front end, connected to an Express / Mongo backend, where users are able to add comments to posts of popular travel locations 



## Requirements:

- A Full Stack MERN app built with React Redux, Express, and MongoDB
- Your site should display posts of popular travel locations, in which users can comment and add reviews to
- User interactivity with forms and buttons on our Front End to add reviews 
- A back end with at least 2 models (posts & comments)


## Recommendations
- Start with 4-5 initial travel locations, and try to use Faker to populate them with reviews
- Focus on the Read methods first, then work on Create, Update, and Delete once we have the Front and Back ends connected
- Be sure to use your notes and previous labs as a resource to help you through this challenge
- ERD's, Component Hierarchy Diagrams, and calls to Insomnia will not be required, but will be very, very highly recommended
